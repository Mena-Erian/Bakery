# 🍞 Bakery  

This project was created during my early CSS learning phase. Although I now have a solid understanding of CSS, including `d-flex`, `grid`, and advanced styling techniques, I am keeping this repository as a **record of my learning journey** and for my **CV**.  

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Bakery Website](https://mena-erian.github.io/Bakery/index.html)  

## 🎓 What I Learned in This Project  

### **HTML Fundamentals**  
- Structuring content with **`div`** and **`span`**.  
- Embedding and working with **images** effectively.  
- Integrating a **Google Map** into the website.  

### **CSS Selectors & Styling**  
- **Element selectors** (e.g., `h1`, `p`).  
- **Class (`.class-name`)** and **ID (`#id-name`)** selectors.  
- **Descendant and child selectors** for better styling control.  
- Using **pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)** for additional styling.  

### **CSS Layout & Positioning**  
- Understanding **display properties**:  
  - `inline`, `block`, `inline-block`.  
- Layout structuring with **float and clear** (before learning `flexbox`).  
- **Positioning elements** using:  
  - `static` (default positioning).  
  - `relative`, `absolute`, and `sticky` for flexible placement.  
- **z-index & stacking context**:  
  - Controlling element layering with `z-index`, especially when using `position: absolute` or `relative`.  

### **Box Model & Spacing**  
- Managing layout using **margin, padding, and borders**.  
- Controlling **overflow** to manage content visibility.  

### **Interactive & Visual Enhancements**  
- Adding **hover effects** for better user interaction.  
- Styling with **fonts, font families, and color systems**.  

🚀 **Now, I have advanced my CSS skills** and can work with:  
✅ `display flex` and `display grid` for modern, responsive layouts.  
✅ CSS animations and transitions.  
✅ Fully responsive design techniques and Other.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Fully styled with **pure CSS** (no frameworks).  
- Embedded **Google Map** for location display.  
- Clean and structured **layout** with proper spacing.
